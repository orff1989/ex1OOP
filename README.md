    In this project we will solve the problem of how to mange elvator control system with the knowing of all the future calls of every floor.

		_**The algorithm:**_
		
		a. The algorithm will check the next call,
		and send to there an elevator that will get to the source floor in time with consideration the next calls.
		
		b.After sending the elevator, the algorithm will check the next calls and plan the path of the elevator.
		
		c.If the next call is on the way of the moving elevator and at the same direction,
		the elevator will stop at this floor and continue to move.
		else, the algorithm will calculte what elevator will get faster to the new floor and count the direction of the elevator.
		
		d. If the algorithm will recognize that will be load from some area it will send there elevators.
